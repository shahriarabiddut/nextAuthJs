# Understanding `--force` and `--legacy-peer-deps` in npm

When installing packages with `npm`, you may encounter dependency conflicts.  
Two common flags to handle these are:

## `--force`

Forces installation, **ignoring dependency conflicts**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This can break your project by overriding package versions.

### Example:

```sh
npm install package-a --force
```

**Scenario:**

- `package-a` requires `React 17`, but you have `React 18`.
- `--force` will install `package-a` anyway, potentially causing issues.

---

## `--legacy-peer-deps`

Skips strict **peer dependency checks**, allowing installation even if dependencies don‚Äôt match.  
‚úÖ **Safer than `--force`, but still use with caution.**

### Example:

```sh
npm install package-b --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Scenario:**

- `package-b` requires `React 16`, but you have `React 18`.
- `--legacy-peer-deps` installs `package-b` **without forcing React 16**.

---

## When to Use?

- **Try `--legacy-peer-deps` first.**
- If that fails, **use `--force` as a last resort**.

üìå **Always test your project after using these flags to avoid breaking changes!**
